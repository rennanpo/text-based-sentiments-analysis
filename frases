New UAW slogan: Fighting for their right to steal money from workers
The resources I consume personally are very low.
Am thinking of starting new university: Texas Institute of Technology & Science
Tuition is in Dogecoin & u get a discount if u have a dog
Nothing matters
Almost no one understands this

I’ve thought about and… I’m not sorry for party rocking
I had too many bottles of Teslaquila!
